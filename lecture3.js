/*  1. Explain the following code:
 *
 *  function func() {
 *      console.log(this);
 *  }
 *
 *  func(); // what is the output? Why?
 *  It will output the windows object on the console because the this method points to the parent object which in this case is the window object.
 * 
 * 
 *  var obj = {
 *      func: func // what is the second func here?
 *  };
 *  
 *  obj.func(); //what is the output? try to explain why.
 *  Will print the obj  object because 'this' in the function 'func' now points to the obj object not the windows object

 * 
 * 
 *  obj.func.bind(window)(); // what is the output? why?
 *  It will display the windows object because the function 'func' is now bound to the windows object and not 'obj' object
 *
 *  obj.func.bind(this)();  // what is the output? why?
 * It prints out the windows object because 'this' binds the 'func' to the windows object
 * 
 *  var people = {
 *      name: 'ashwin',
 *      age: 40
 *  };
 *
 *  obj.func.bind(people)(); //what is the output? why?
 */
   //  This will print out the 'people' object because 'func' is now bound to 'people' object


/* 2. write a function to convert first letter of every word in a string
 *     to upper case.
 *     eg input = 'hi, welcome to mest;'
 *        output = 'Hi Welcome To Mest';
 *        input2 = 'today is Sunday';
 *        output2 = 'Today is Sunday';

/*
 * 4. what is localStorage and sessionStorge under window object? What is the
 *    difference
 */

/* 
  For sessionStorage, changes are only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). 
  Changes made are saved and available for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window is closed, the storage is deleted.

  localStorage and sessionStorage both extend Storage. There is no difference between them except for the intended "non-persistence" of sessionStorage.
